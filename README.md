# Purpose

It's your actual DeskDuck off of RISC OS, innit?

The original was written by Stuart Payne.

# Pre-requisites

Python3, wxPython

Install all python dependencies by running:
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Execution

python3 deskduck.py

# TODO

I need to get a sample of the quack sound from the original RISC OS sound
module.
